## Synopsis ##

This is a Haskell library providing effective representation for [sparse matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) and some linear algebra on them.

## Installation ##

1. Dowload it:

    ```bash
    $ git clone git://github.com/laughedelic/sparse-lin-alg.git
    ```

2. Install

    ```bash
    $ cd sparse-lin-alg
    $ cabal install
    ```

That's it!

There are some QuickCheck tests, but at the moment they don't cover whole library.

## Documentation ##

If you run `cabal haddock` in the directory, where you downloaded library, you'll get documentation and will be able to view it from the root at `dist/doc/html/sparse-lin-alg/index.html`.

You can also view it online at [Hackage package page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sparse-lin-alg), but it may be not up to date.
