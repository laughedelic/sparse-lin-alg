## Synopsis ##

This is a small Haskell library providing effective representation for [sparse matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) and some linear algebra operations on them.

## Installation ##

1. Dowload it:

    ```bash
    $ git clone git://github.com/laughedelic/sparse-lin-alg.git
    $ cd sparse-lin-alg
    ```

2. Install

    ```bash
    $ cabal install
    ```

That's it!

There are some QuickCheck tests, but at the moment they don't cover whole library, so check it out in the future versions.
